# magento2-disable-swatch

If you're encountering issues with the swatch_image attribute when uploading or removing images, it's likely because Magento is interpreting or validating the images in the product gallery as swatch images in certain contexts. This can happen especially if Magento expects swatch images for products that have specific attributes configured as swatches (e.g., color or material).

To avoid errors related to swatch_image, let’s cover two main things:

Check When Swatch Images are Required:

Magento requires swatch_image when you have attributes that are set to use visual swatches. For example, if your product has a color or pattern attribute that displays options with images, Magento will look for the swatch_image attribute.
You can check if a product attribute is configured to use swatches in the Magento Admin:
Go to Stores > Attributes > Product.
Find attributes like "color" or "pattern" that may use swatches.
If Catalog Input Type for Store Owner is set to "Visual Swatch," Magento will look for a corresponding swatch_image.
Avoid swatch_image Requirement by Using Non-Swatch Image Types:

To avoid swatch_image errors, ensure that the images you upload for products are assigned to image roles that don’t expect swatches.
Magento supports various image roles, such as:
Base Image: Primary image for the product.
Small Image: Used in catalog listings.
Thumbnail: Used in the shopping cart and related sections.
Swatch Image: Specific to visual swatches.
If you’re using a custom module to manage images, avoid setting the image role to swatch_image unless the attribute is actually a swatch.

Code Check and Example to Set Non-Swatch Image Roles in Your Custom Module:

Ensure that any programmatic image uploads in your custom module set the image type to one of the safe roles (base_image, small_image, or thumbnail) instead of swatch_image. You can do this in your Save controller or model.
Here’s an example of how to save a product image while avoiding swatch_image:

```php
$product = $this->productRepository->getById($productId);
$product->addImageToMediaGallery($filePath, ['image', 'small_image', 'thumbnail'], false, false);
$this->productRepository->save($product);
In this example, the image is set as image, small_image, and thumbnail but not as swatch_image. This ensures the image will not trigger errors related to swatches.
```

Summary of Steps to Avoid swatch_image Errors
Check product attributes: Ensure attributes that use visual swatches actually need swatch_image.
Assign images to non-swatch roles: Use roles like image, small_image, and thumbnail in your custom module.
Only use swatch_image when necessary: Assign it only when working with swatch attributes explicitly.
By following these steps, you should avoid swatch_image errors and ensure your images are uploaded correctly without conflicting with Magento’s swatch functionality.
